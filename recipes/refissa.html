        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Rfissa is a traditional Moroccan dish known for its comforting and aromatic flavors. It is typically prepared with tender chicken, lentils, and a rich, spiced sauce infused with saffron, turmeric, and Ras el Hanout. The dish is served over **trid**, a type of flaky Moroccan flatbread that absorbs the flavorful sauce, making it soft and delicious. Often enjoyed during special occasions or family gatherings, Rfissa is a symbol of Moroccan hospitality and is particularly popular during celebrations like the birth of a child. Its warm, hearty nature makes it a beloved staple in Moroccan cuisine.</p>
